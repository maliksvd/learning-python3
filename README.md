# Learning Python3 - Scripts

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that I've created while learning Python. Each script is designed to demonstrate different aspects of the Python programming language, and can be run in a Python 3 environment. It may contain errors because I am still learning.

## List of Scripts

Here is a list of the scripts contained in this repository, along with a brief description of each one:

password-generator: Generates a random password based on user input.
guessing-game: Asks the user to guess a randomly generated number.
palindrome-checker: Checks if a given word or phrase is a palindrome.
prime-number-checker: Checks if a given number is prime.
rock-paper-scissors: A simple game of rock-paper-scissors that can be played against the computer.

## Getting Started

To run any of these scripts, you'll need Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
